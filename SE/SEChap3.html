                <p>Software engineering activities, especially for large systems, require the coordination of many people (stakeholders) who must be arranged into teams. Their primary objective is to build a product that meets defined requirements. The entire effort must be organized into a cohesive project with a solid plan for success. Finally, to successfully develop the product, the activities of the people must be organized through use of an orderly and well-defined process.</p>
