    <h1>SOFTWARE PROCESS MODELS</h1>
    <p class="highlight-box">CIT 214 - Software Engineering</p>

    <h3>What are Software Process Models?</h3>
    <p>Process models define the approach and workflow for developing software. Each model offers different advantages depending on project requirements, team size, and risk factors.</p>

    <div class="model-section">
        <h2>WATERFALL PROCESS MODEL</h2>
        <div class="definition">
            <p><strong> One of the oldest software process models.</strong> Despite many of its weaknesses, the waterfall process is still in widespread use today and is the basis for many other more effective processes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-group">
            <div class="tabs">
                <div class="tab tab-blue active" onclick="openTab(event, 'characteristics')" title="Key Characteristics"></div>
                <div class="tab tab-green" onclick="openTab(event, 'how-it-works')" title="How It Works"></div>

            </div>
                
            <div id="characteristics" class="tab-content information-tab active">
                <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
                <p>The waterfall model follows a sequential approach with distinct phases. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, with minimal overlap between phases.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="how-it-works" class="tab-content key-takeaway-tab">
                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>Organizations typically implement waterfall starting with requirements, excluding inception and planning phases. Each phase produces specific documentation before proceeding to the next phase. Entrance and exit criteria ensure successful phase completion.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="limitations" class="tab-content warning-tab">
                <h3>Important Limitations</h3>
                <p>Testing occurs at the end of development—the first time the system is tested as a whole. Major issues like timing, performance, and storage problems are discovered late, potentially jeopardizing the project schedule.</p>

            <h3>Advantages of the Waterfall Process Model</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Simple and easy to use</strong> Phases are executed and completed serially, with specific entrance and exit criteria for moving between phases. Orderly execution of phases is easy to comprehend.</li>
                <li><strong>Practiced for many years and people have much experience with it</strong> The process is well understood, and many people are comfortable with its execution.</li>
                <li><strong>Easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model</strong> Each phase has specific deliverables and a review process.</li>
                <li><strong>Facilitates allocation of resources</strong> Distinct phases facilitate allocation of personnel with distinct skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood</strong> It's necessary to add complexity of iteration if requirements are well known up front.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="disadvantages failure-factors">
            <h3>Disadvantages of the Waterfall Process Model</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Requirements must be known up front</strong> It's difficult to imagine every detail in advance. Most projects start out with some uncertainty, and more details are learned as the project progresses.</li>
                <li><strong>Hard to estimate reliably</strong> To gain confidence in an estimate, there may be a need to design and implement parts, especially riskier ones. Estimate become more precise as the project progresses.</li>
                <li><strong>No feedback of system by stakeholders until after testing phase</strong> The process does not facilitate intermediate versions. Stakeholders often need reassurance of progress and confirmation that what is being developed meets requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Major problems with system aren't discovered until late in process</strong> The testing phase is where these problems are found, but it leaves very little time for correction, resulting in potentially disastrous effects on project schedule and cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of parallelism</strong> Each phase is executed to completion. Disjointed parts of the system could otherwise be completed in parallel.</li>
                <li><strong>Inefficient use of resources</strong> Team members can be idle while waiting for others to complete their dependent tasks or for phases to complete. Someone good at requirements analysis is not necessarily good at programming.</li>

                <h3>WATERFALL (unsummarized)</h3>
                <p>In practice, most organizations implement a waterfall process starting with the requirements phase, excluding the inception and planning phases. The waterfall executes in a sequential manner through each phase, concluding with maintenance.</p>
        
                <p>The output from one phase is used as input for the next, implying that a phase is not started until the previous one has completed. It is accepted in waterfall processes that there is a small overlap between adjacent phases.</p>
                
                <p>The waterfall process is characterized by documents generated by the time each phase is completed. These include requirements specification and design specification. There are usually entrance and exit criteria between phases to ensure that a phase is completed successfully before moving on.</p>
                
                <p>In practice, an iterative relationship between successive phases is usually inevitable. A major limitation of the waterfall process is that the testing phase occurs at the end of the development cycle - the first time the system is tested as a whole.</p>
                
                <p>Major issues such as timing, performance, storage, and so on can be discovered only then. Discovering and repairing defects so late in the development cycle can jeopardize the project schedule.</p>

        <h2>ITERATIVE AND INCREMENTAL MODEL</h2>
        
        <div class="concept">
            <h3>Core Concept</h3>
            <p>Software is more naturally developed in a cyclical manner, where a part of the system is developed and tested, feedback is gathered, and based on the feedback more of the system is developed.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="definition">
            <p>An <strong>iterative process</strong> is typified by repeated execution of the waterfall phases, in whole or in part, resulting in a refinement of the requirements, design, and implementation.</p>
        
            <p>An iterative process is <strong>incremental</strong> if each iteration is relatively small. At the conclusion of such an iteration, a piece of operational code is produced that supports a subset of the final product functionality and features.</p>

                <h3>Key Elements</h3>
                <p>Project artifacts evolve during each phase. Successive increments implement increasing functionality until the final product. Each iteration is self-contained with its own activities, objectives, and evaluation criteria. Iterations can be developed in parallel by separate teams.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="release" class="tab-content information-tab">
                <h3>Release Types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Proof of concept or feasibility study</strong><br> Demonstrates or investigates feasibility of particular aspects</li>
                    <li><strong>Prototype</strong><br> Working version demonstrating high-risk capabilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Internal release</strong><br> Used by the development team to ensure development is on track</li>

                <h3>Best Practices</h3>
                <p>Testing each iteration as a self-contained project allows clear objectives and reduces complexity. Producing working software at each iteration helps monitor progress and gather feedback. Early iterations should address high-risk aspects to reduce overall project risk.</p>

                    <h3>ITERATIVE & INCREMENTAL MODEL (unsummarized)</h3>
                    <p>Project artifacts such as plans, specifications, and code evolve during each phase and over the life of the project. Artifacts are considered only when the software is released.</p>
                        
                    <p>Incremental development is a scheduling and staging strategy that allows pieces of the system to be developed at different times or rates and integrated as they completed. Iterations need not be executed serially, but can be developed in parallel by separate teams of people.</p>
                    
                    <p>Successive increments implement an increasing set of functionality and features until the final iteration, which produces the final product. Each iteration is a self-contained project with its own set of activities, plan, objectives, and measurable evaluation criteria.</p>
                    
                    <p>The release is a working version of software that is either used internally by the project team or externally by stakeholders and customers.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Types of Releases</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Proof of concept, or feasibility study</strong>, that is used to demonstrate or investigate feasibility of a particular aspect of the software. This includes producing software simulations.</li>
                        <li><strong>A prototype</strong> that is a working version of software demonstrating a particular capability that is deemed high risk.</li>
                        <li><strong>An internal release</strong> that is only used by the development team and is used to ensure that development is on track, elicit feedback, and provide a basis for further development and additional capabilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>An external release</strong> that is shipped to customers for evaluation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Testing each iteration as a self-contained project allows clear and manageable objectives to be set, and reduces overall project complexity by breaking it down into smaller pieces.</p>
                    
                    <p>By producing software at the end of each iteration, project progress can more easily be monitored and planned, and feedback can be elicited to ensure that its capabilities are meeting stakeholder requirements.</p>
                    
                    <p>Typically, early iterations generate software releases that address aspects of the project with the highest risk. In this way, as the project progresses, the overall project risk level is reduced.</p>

        <h2>SPIRAL MODEL</h2>

        <div class="concept">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Barry Boehm's Spiral Model is one of the earliest and best-known iterative processes. It's called a "spiral" because development iterates as an outward spiral, with each cycle representing one iteration.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tab-group">
            <div class="tabs">

            <div id="risk-driven" class="tab-content key-takeaway-tab active">
                <h3>Risk-Driven Approach</h3>
                <p>The goal of each cycle is to increase system definition and implementation while decreasing risk. Risk management is built into the process with early risk identification in each iteration. The overall project risk reduces as you progress outward in the spiral.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="spiral-steps" class="tab-content information-tab">
                <h3>Spiral Model Iteration Steps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify critical objectives and constraints</li>
                    <li>Evaluate project and process alternatives</li>
                    <li>Identify risks</li>
                    <li>Cost-effectively resolve risks using analysis, prototypes, etc.</li>
                    <li>Develop project deliverables</li>
                    <li>Plan for future cycles and update the project plan</li>
                    <li>Review with stakeholders and commit to proceeding</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div id="spiral-implement" class="tab-content example-tab">
                <h3>Implementation Pattern</h3>
                <p>Each spiral traversal produces incremental deliverables. Early iterations yield models or prototypes, while later iterations follow a more waterfall-like process producing more complete software versions. The number of cycles depends on project size, identified risks, and their retirement rate.</p>

            <h3>Advantages of the Spiral Model</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Risks are managed early and throughout the process.</strong> Risks are reduced before they become problematic, as they are considered at all stages. As a result, stakeholders can better understand and react to risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Software evolves as the project progresses.</strong> It is a realistic approach to the development of large-scale software. Errors and unattractive alternatives are eliminated early.</li>
                <li><strong>Planning is built into the process.</strong> Each cycle includes a planning step to help monitor and keep a project on track.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="disadvantages failure-factors">
            <h3>Disadvantages of the Spiral Model</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Complicated to use.</strong> Risk analysis requires highly specific expertise. There is inevitably some overlap between iterations.</li>
                <li><strong>May be overkill for small projects.</strong> The complication may not be necessary for smaller projects. It does not make sense if the cost of risk analysis is a major part of the overall project cost.</li>

                    <p>One of the earliest and best known iterative processes is Barry Boehm's Spiral Model. It is called a spiral because Boehm conceptualized development iterating as an outward spiral. It is a risk-driven process in which iterations have the specified goals.</p>
        
                    <p>A project starts at the center, as it were, and each cycle of the spiral represents one iteration. The goal of each cycle is to increase the degree of system definition and implementation, while decreasing the degree of risk.</p>
                    
                    <p>Risk management is built into the process in that very early in each iteration, project risks are identified and analyzed and a plan for the iteration is created that includes mitigating some or all of the risks.</p>
                    
                    <p>The overall project risk reduces the further along you are in the process. After the major risks are addressed and mitigated, the project transitions to a waterfall model as seen in the outer spiral.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Each iteration in Boehm's spiral model consists of the following steps:</h3>

                <li><strong>The project always has demonstrable results.</strong> The end product of each iteration is working software.</li>
                <li><strong>Developers tend to be more motivated.</strong> Developers prefer to produce working artifacts and tend not to like creating documentation.</li>

            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Problematical for large applications.</strong> Agile methods are more steadily used for smaller projects. There is a debate about their utility for large projects.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation output is questionable.</strong> Since documentation takes second place, there is a question as to whether necessary documentation will ever be produced.</li>

        <div class="concept">
            <h3>Purpose of Prototyping</h3>
            <p>Prototyping is an important risk management technique. It involves creating a partial implementation to identify and retire risky parts of a project.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-group">

                <h3>Benefits</h3>
                <p>Prototyping helps obtain ideas about customer requirements and increases understanding of what's to come, saving expensive rework and removing future roadblocks.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="tab2" class="tab-content example-tab">
                <h3>Implementation Examples</h3>
                <p>Simple graphics showing GUIs using paint-type tools may be sufficient if the prototype's goal is to envision interfaces. More extensive prototypes can retire more risks.</p>

                <h3>When to Consider Prototyping</h3>
                <p>Consider prototyping when:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requirements are unclear or complex</li>
                    <li>Stakeholders need visual confirmation</li>
                    <li>New technology is being implemented</li>
                    <li>High-risk components need validation early</li>

            <h3>Waterfall</h3>
            <p>follows strict phases that must be done before proceeding to the next phase, with minimal overlap</p>
            <h3>Iterative & Incremental</h3>
            <p>repeated execution of waterfall phases, you should address the ones with high risks at the first iteration, and with every iteration, the project gets more refined</p>
            <h3>Spiral</h3>
            <p>represented as outward spiral, the risk management is built in every iteration, Early iterations produce either models, emulations, benchmarks, or prototypes, and then the last and final iteration follows a waterfall-like process</p>
            <h3>Agile</h3>
            <p>Started in 2001, follows the values and principles from the Agile Manifesto created by the Agile Alliance. Highly iterative and incremental, has a customer representative in the team, prioritizes working software over documentation during the process</p>
