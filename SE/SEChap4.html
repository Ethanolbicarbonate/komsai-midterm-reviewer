<div class="model-section">
    <h2>MAJOR PRINCIPLES OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</h2>
    
    <div class="concept">
        <p>Software engineering principles are fundamental guidelines that, when followed, help in developing high-quality software products efficiently and effectively.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Make Quality Number 1 -->
    <div class="advantages success-factors">
        <h3>Make Quality Number 1</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>There is nothing more important than delivering a quality product to customers - they simply will not tolerate anything less.</li>
            <li>Different people have different ideas of what quality means, and it therefore must be specified and measured.</li>
            <li>Prime examples of quality are how closely software meets the customer's requirements, how many (or few) defects it has, and how much it costs to produce.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>High Quality Software is Possible</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Although it may be difficult to produce high-quality software, following modern software engineering techniques and methods has proven to meet reasonable quality goals.</li>
            <li>Examples involving the customer, prototyping, conducting inspections, and employing incremental software processes.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>Give Products to Customers Early</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Many software projects fail because customers are given their first look at software too late in the development cycle. This was a major motivation for the introduction of agile methods.</li>
            <li>It's virtually impossible to know all the requirements in advance, and involving customers as early as possible is critical to getting the requirements right.</li>
            <li>Giving the customers early working software and having them use it is critical to understanding what they really need.</li>
            <li>Employing techniques such as prototyping, or incremental processes allow customers to get software into their hands early in the development life cycle.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>Use an Appropriate Software Process</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>There are many software process models, and no single one is appropriate for every type of project.</li>
            <li>Waterfall process works well for projects where all of the requirements are well known up front.</li>
            <li>Agile and other iterative processes are called for when few requirements are known in advance.</li>
            <li>Good software engineers and project leaders take the time to understand the type of project being undertaken and use an appropriate model.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>Minimize Intellectual Distance</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>For any software solution to a real-world problem, the structures of both the software solution and real-world problem should be as similar as possible.</li>
            <li>The closer the structures to each other, the easier it is to maintain and develop and maintain the software.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>Inspect All Artifacts</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>An artifact is any product of the software development process.</li>
            <li>Includes technical specifications, test plans, documentation, and code.</li>
            <li>Inspections have been proven to find errors as early as possible, increase quality, and decrease overall project cost.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>People Are The Key to Success</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Highly skilled, motivated people are probably the most important factor contributing to the success of a software project.</li>
            <li>Good people can make up for a variety of obstacles including poor tools, insufficient processes, and unforeseen problems.</li>
            <li>Hiring and retaining the best people is critical to producing high-quality and successful software.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="key-takeaway">
        <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
        <p>Following these seven fundamental principles can significantly improve the quality of software products and the efficiency of the development process.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Common Software Myths Section -->
<div class="model-section">
    <h2>COMMON SOFTWARE MYTHS</h2>
    
    <div class="concept">
        <p>Common misconceptions about software development that can lead to unrealistic expectations and poor decision-making.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Myth 1 -->
    <div class="disadvantages failure-factors">
        <h3>"Good software is Bug-Free"</h3>
        <p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>While it is true that software without bugs is desirable, achieving completely bug-free software is practically impossible.</li>
            <li>The focus of software development should not be on eliminating all bugs but on minimizing their occurrence and impact.</li>
            <li>Moreover, some bugs may not be critical enough to impact the overall functionality of the software. Some bugs may be low priority or have minimal impact, which means that fixing them may not be worth the time and resources.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>"The More Features, the Better the Software"</h3>
        <p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>While having a wide range of features can make a product seem more attractive, it can also lead to several issues.</li>
            <li>Having too many features can make software bloated and difficult to use.</li>
            <li>Additional features require more development time and resources, leading to longer development cycles and increased costs.</li>
            <li>The more features that are added, the greater the likelihood of bugs and compatibility issues arising.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>"Software development is a solitary activity"</h3>
        <p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>While it is true that software developers often spend a significant amount of time working independently, software development is also a highly collaborative process.</li>
            <li>Software development involves teamwork, where developers work together to design, code, test, and deploy complex software systems.</li>
            <li>Software development teams often include people with different areas of expertise, such as developers, testers, project managers, and designers, who work together to build high-quality software.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>"Software engineers write code all day"</h3>
        <p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Software engineers only spend fractions of the day writing code.</li>
            <li>They are not just involved in testing, coding, or developing software. They can also become data analysts, business analysts, product managers as well.</li>
            <li>The software development process also takes a lot more than just coding.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>"An extra developer will speed things up"</h3>
        <p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>When a new developer joins a team, there is always an initial decrease in per-person productivity.</li>
            <li>Onboarding takes time, and acclimating a new developer to a project takes time away from the development team's development-focused activities.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, in the world of software development, smaller teams are proven to be more product, adaptable and agile than larger ones.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>"Developers aren't creative"</h3>
        <p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Software development takes a great deal of creativity.</li>
            <li>Anybody can learn how an API works. However, the ability to use an API and apply it to an unsolved problem takes a great deal of creativity.</li>
            <li>The people who stand-out on a software development team are the ones who twist and turn methods and functions in unpredictable ways, and conjure up incredibly creative solutions to difficult and complex problems.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>"Open source software is less secure"</h3>
        <p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>There is no qualitative evidence to suggest that open source software is any more or less secure than software developed by a vendor.</li>
            <li>Many contend that because the source code behind open source software is publicly available, any hacker with nefarious intent could easily crack that code. In fact, the opposite is true.</li>
            <li>With open source software, hundreds if not thousands of people scour through updates, enhancements and even stale source code that hasn't been touched in years to regularly check and test the codebase.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>"Open source software is built by individual contributors"</h3>
        <p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>The biggest contributors to open source software are often proprietary vendors.</li>
            <li>According to Jonathan Corbet of lwn.net, Huawei had 117 developers working on the 6.1 Linux kernel, and 37% of the lines of code changed were contributed by Oracle, AMD, Google, Intel and IBM.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>"Programmers need to be experts at math"</h3>
        <p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>Software development probably isn't a great career choice for someone who has trouble with addition and multiplication, but you don't need to know how to differentiate the Heisenberg equation to build a microservice.</li>
            <li>There is very little math involved in enterprise software development, and what little math there is doesn't typically go beyond addition, multiplication and the modulus operator.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>"Agile doesn't require documentation"</h3>
        <p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>One of the core tenets of the Agile Manifesto is: Working software over comprehensive documentation.</li>
            <li>Agile certainly takes the approach to documentation that less is more, but it still requires documentation.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>"The Latest Technology is Always the Best Choice"</h3>
        <p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>New technology is often more expensive than older technology, making it less feasible for businesses and individuals with limited budgets.</li>
            <li>New technology can have compatibility issues with existing systems, leading to integration challenges and other operational disruptions.</li>
            <li>New technology may not be mature enough to meet all the requirements of its users.</li>
            <li>Older technology can still be reliable and effective, especially if it meets the specific needs of its users.</li>
        </ul><hr style="opacity: 30%;">
        <h3>"ChatGPT will make software developers obsolete"</h3>
        <p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>As good as ChatGPT is, it still creates broken code that either doesn't compile or doesn't quite meet the requirements.</li>
            <li>Programmers who know how to code and how to turn detailed requirements into deployable software will continue to be in demand into the near future.</li>
            <li>AI-driven tools won't replace developers, they're going to need more of them, and also more from them.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
        <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
