                <h2>WHAT IS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING?</h2>
                
                <div class="concept">
                    <p>Software Engineering is an engineering discipline that involves all aspects of developing and maintaining a software product. Like other engineering disciplines such as civil and electrical, it involves the design, analysis, and construction of an artifact for some practical purpose.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="definition">
                    <p><strong>The IEEE defines software engineering as</strong> - 1. The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software, that is, the application of engineering to software. 2. The study of approaches as in (1).</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>It's not only what is produced that's important but also how it is produced. Engineering disciplines employ an established set of systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approaches to development of artifacts.</p>
                
                <p>By applying an analogous set of approaches to the development of software, we can expect the production of software that is highly reliable, is maintainable, and meets specified requirements.</p>
                
                <p>A disciplined approach is particularly important as the size of a software project grows.</p>
                
                <div class="key-takeaway">
                    <h3>Goal of Software Engineering</h3>
                    <p>The creation of software systems that meet the needs of customers and are <strong>reliable, efficient, and maintainable</strong>. The system should be produced in an economical fashion, meeting project schedules and budgets.</p>

                        <p><strong>Cost</strong> - $18.5 million</p>
                        <p><strong>Disaster</strong> - The Mariner 1 rocket with a space probe headed for Venus diverted from its intended flight path shortly after launch. Mission Control destroyed the rocket 293 seconds after liftoff.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cause</strong> - A programmer incorrectly transcribed a handwritten formula into computer code, missing a single superscript bar. Without the smoothing function indicated by the bar, the software treated normal variations of velocity as if they were serious, causing faulty corrections that sent the rocket off course.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p><strong>Cost</strong> - Nearly all of humanity</p>
                        <p><strong>Disaster</strong> - The Soviet early warning system falsely indicated the United States had launched five ballistic missiles. Fortunately the Soviet duty officer had a "funny feeling in my gut" and reasoned if the U.S. was really attacking they would launch more than five missiles, so he reported the apparent attack as a false alarm.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cause</strong> - A bug in the Soviet software failed to filter out false missile detections caused by sunlight reflecting off cloud-tops.</p>

                        <p><strong>Cost</strong> - Three people dead, three people critically injured</p>
                        <p><strong>Disaster</strong> - Canada's Therac-25 radiation therapy machine malfunctioned and delivered lethal radiation doses to patients.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cause</strong> - Because of a subtle bug called a race condition, a technician could accidentally configure Therac-25 so the electron beam would fire in high-power mode without the proper patient shielding.</p>

                        <p><strong>Cost</strong> - $500 billion</p>
                        <p><strong>Disaster</strong> - One man's disaster is another man's fortune, as demonstrated by the infamous Y2K bug. Businesses spent billions on programmers to fix a glitch in legacy software. While no significant computer failures occurred, preparation for the Y2K bug had a significant cost and time impact on all industries that use computer technology.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cause</strong> - To save computer storage space, legacy software often stored the year for dates as two digit numbers, such as "99" for 1999. The software also interpreted "00" to mean 1900 rather than 2000, so when the year 2000 came along, bugs would result.</p>

                        <p><strong>Disaster</strong> - Radiation therapy software by Multidata Systems International miscalculated the proper dosage, exposing patients to harmful and in some cases fatal levels of radiation. The physicians, who were legally required to double-check the software's calculations, were indicted for murder.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cause</strong> - The software calculated radiation dosage based on the order in which data was entered, sometimes delivering a double dose of radiation.</p>
