                        <li><strong>Human Resources</strong> - Assemble a development team with appropriate skills and experience. Consider turnover and job vacancies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Experience with Similar Projects</strong> - Develop estimates based on resources used for similar, previously developed systems.</li>

                        <li><strong>Start Day/Date</strong> - The time that a task is scheduled to begin</li>

                    <h3>Types of Task Patterns</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dependent Tasks</strong> - When tasks must be completed one after another. One task depends on the other, similar to a relay race.

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple Successor Tasks</strong> - When several tasks can start at the same time. Each is called a concurrent task. Often, two or more concurrent tasks depend on a single prior task, which is called a predecessor task.
                            <p style="font-style: italic; opacity: 70%;">"When Task 2 is finished, start two tasks: Task 3 and Task 4"</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple Predecessor Tasks</strong> - When a task requires two or more prior tasks to be completed before it can start.
                            <p style="font-style: italic; opacity: 70%;">"When Tasks 5 and 6 are done, start Task 7"</p>
